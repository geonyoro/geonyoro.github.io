		<h1>Launchform</h1>
		<p>This is a project I created while in school during my 4th year to help students find information on attachments and empower them in the process. I however discontinued it after it became hard to maintain it.</p>

		<h2>Background</h2>
		<p>At the end of my 3rd year in university, we were required to attend industrial attachments for a minimum of 2 months at a company where we could hone our engineering skills and put in practice the skills we had been learning. The process of finding a company where one could attend turned out to be a really challenging one in the sense that we did not know any companies out there! The department had a list of a few companies that one could attend and I ended up going to one for 3 weeks.</p>

		<p>However, I felt there should be a listing of sorts of all the companies where one could actually go, and provide vital information such as:
		<ul>
			<li>Location</li>
			<li>Courses that can go there for internship</li>
			<li>Minimum Duration of attachment offered</li>
			<li>Skills one could learn</li>
			<li>Allowances offered</li>
			<li>Feedback from other students who have attended the same</li>
		</ul>
		</p>

		<h2>Implementation</h2>
		<p>I created the site and over a span of a year, it underwent various designs and redesigns of various aspects to help students contribute information and create a sizeable database of information.
		For instance:</p>

		<p>The front-end for filling information was modified from a single page that contained all fields for filling, to three pages, to make it appear more bearable to the user. <strong>Pagination</strong> works.</p>

		<p>The number of fields for filling were later reduced to the bare minimum so that the process of contributing to the site was not seen as labourious.</p>

		<p>At first, all contributers were required to create user accounts with usernames, passwords and emails, however, that was later seen to make the process seem longer. Additionally, people tend to forget passwords! In the final design, one could simply contribute by filling a few fields, then at the end of the process the data is accepted and option is given to associate the data with a user. The login via username and password option was scrapped and a <a href="http://www.facebook.com" target="blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://www.Google.com" target="blank">Google</a> login were preferred, since no password would be needed. Making work easier!</p>
