		<h1>Silverstone Tyre Tool</h1>
		<p>This is a tool created to enable customers to search for the right tyres that fit their vehicle. I created it as part of my work under <a href="http://luvaria.co.ke" target="blank">Luvaria Systems</a>. The tool can be found <a href="http://silverstone.luvaria.co.ke/" target="blank">here</a>.</p>
		It allows:
		<ul>
			<li>Searching based on Vehicle Make</li>
			<li>Searching based on Model</li>
			<li>Searching based on Engine</li>
			<li>Administrator Upload/Download of Database File</li>
		</ul>
		</p>

		<h2>Implementation</h2>
		<p>It took about 19 hours of development to get it running. It implements <em>CodeIgniter</em> in the background.</p>

		<p>The administrator uploads files <em>Excel/CSV File</em> containing a list of tyres and another containing a list of vehicles, engines, details etc. During the upload process the documents are parsed and fed into the database.</p>

		<p>For the front-end, <em>JQuery</em> is used to to autocomplete the fields as one searches for the appropriate details and filters them by that.</p>
