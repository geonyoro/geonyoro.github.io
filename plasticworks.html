		<h1>PlasticWorks App</h1>
		<p>This was an app for a company that specialises in plastic molding based in Canada.</p>
		<p>They needed an application that would help them calculate total costs of molding for different situations. It had an excel-like table area at the bottom allowing for addition of other rows to include different items.</p>

		<p>The slider in the top indicating complexity could be changed from 0 to 10, with each level of complexity linking to a different image that was determined by the user. They simply placed an image in a certain folder with the equivalent name .e.g complexity-5.png for the 5th level of complexity and so on. As such, when the slider was moved, different images would be displayed.</p>
		<p>This took 4 days to develop in 2014. It was developed on Tkinter and as such could be deployed on any platform running Python, including Windows.</p>
