		<h1>Ebay Discogs CSV Generator</h1>
		<p>This app was created as a post-cursor of the CSV Generator.</p>
		<p>The app in this case was now meant to take in files containing some identifiers that would be searched for in Ebay, and details of each of the items retreived from Ebay. If the details were not found on ebay, then they would try be retreived from the database, and also some details that were in non-English languages as retreived from Ebay would be replaced by those equivalent in English found in the database. For each item, it would only be listed in the output file if only its price as calculated from slots for formulae provided met a certain threshold. The final output file in 'csv' format would be uploaded to another site like Discogs.</p>
		<p>It took about 2 weeks to develop and was done in 2015.  It was developed on Tkinter and as such could be deployed on any platform running Python, including Windows.</p>
