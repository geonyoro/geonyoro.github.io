		<h1>CSV Extractor</h1>
		<p>This app was just meant to have a large XML format database downloaded from Discogs containing all the songs pointed to the app and the app would go through the entire database and export details from each of the items. An input file provided would list details of all the items for which details were required and they would be saved to the output file listed.</p>
		<p> I developed it in November 2014. It took 3 days to develop and test. It was developed on Tkinter and as such could be deployed on any platform running Python, including Windows/</p>
