		<h1>VLC Wifi Controller</h1>
		<p>This is an app I created for my Ubuntu Linux to thoroughly enhance my laziness. One can setup a hotspot on a phone or simply connect to the same wifi network a computer is connected to, and navigate using the browser to a certain ULR presented.</p>
		<p>From there, you have a web based remote controller. And it is <strong>not limited</strong> by range or even clear line of sight between the remote and the screen.</p>
		<p>It allows:
		<ul>
			<li>Display of current playing file.</li>
			<li>Forward/Pause/Play/Rewind operations</li>
			<li>Volume Manipulations</li>
			<li>Switch off the app and VLC!</li>
		</ul>
		</p>

		<h2>Implementation</h2>
		<p>It took about 5 hours of development to get it running. It leverages the power of <em>dBus</em> interprocess communication API for communicating with VLC in the background.</p>

		<p>The server process that runs the web interface is based on <em>Flask</em>. The app is written in python and thus uses the dbus python API. It can only run on Linux since Dbus is only based on linux. </p>
