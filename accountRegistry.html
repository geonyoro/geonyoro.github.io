		<h1>Account Registry Manager</h1>
		<p>This app was created to help an administrator at a boy's club be able to better run the club better by managing the students, receipts and budgets from a computer. </p>
		<p>The platform had 2 options for development, Desktop or Web Based. I chose to web since it is easier to develop and deploy and scales well for multiple users. I developed it in June 2016. It took <strong>2 weeks</strong> to develop and 1 day to test and verify.</p>

		<h2>Implementation</h2>
		<p>The Web App was implemented on <em>CodeIgniter</em> to try maintain an MVC approach to the system. It took the form of a single pager with an Iframe that would then contain on the necessary pages needed.</p>

		<p>It contained the following features summarily:
		<ul>
			<li>Add Expenses and Incomes</li>
			<li>Perform Budgeting at the start of the year</li>
			<li>AutoCompletion Especially in Income and Invoices when typing names(Jquery)</li>
			<li>Ability to print receipts and invoices under special formatting!</li>
			<li>Pagination allowing for better navigation through records that may be in the hundreds.</li>
			<li>Automatic <strong>conversion of payment number to words</strong> for the receipt.</li>
			<li>Filters Ã  la <em>MassMailer</em>, though not as powerful in that this does not contain conjunctions.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>

		<p>The budgeting that is done at the start of the year, as per the client's request, automatically fills in the budget for the rest of the year, but one can edit the budget for a particular month after that. This is since, for this client, the budget per month is pretty much the same.</p>

		<p>Notes under expenses and income are cut short on the view for presentations sake but during printing are enabled in full. The action column is also not shown during printing!</p>

		<p>It was a fun project to undertaken albeit a bit challenging since it was my first time implementing the iframe type of system.</p>
